<p>It's about to get real folks!</p>

<p>I'm really excited to say that doing the <a href="http://hackathon.sparcedge.com">Sparc mobile hackathon</a> will satisfy another goal of mine to become a better developer as well as learning mobile development.</p>

<p>I won't be doing it on my own, but have 2 pretty awesome and super experienced devs, Adam Mack and Beth Bradshaw.  Together we are the Ninjaneers!</p>

<p>Not only will we be having some awesome times pushing our knowledge to new heights, but we will be joining many other awesome developers in the cause.</p>

<p>Being a UI Developer, I sometimes feel pretty intimidated when I start diving into the deeper layers of software development, and although I've made it this far in my career, I always feel somewhat lacking in my knowledge and skill and feel like it's something that I always want to improve upon.  Thankfully, I will be teaming with Adam and Beth as I both look up to them and hope that their ninja skills rubb off on me.</p>

<p>There are only a few remaining items left to figure out before the hackathon begins...and that would be our ninjaneer uniforms and whether or not we are going to go native and use objective c or use Apache Cordova/Phonegap.</p>

<p>Seeing as how everyday I pretty much live in javascript, I'm inclined to want to use a framework, but both Adam and Beth are seasoned programmers in Java and C, so it would probably make sense for them to want to code native.</p>

<p>They have both showed interest in using framework like Cordova, so I'm a little excited, but also am a little curious about writing a native app too.</p>

<p>I guess we will see as we're going to start doing our coding workouts together to hopefully warm up and be in 'shape' for the event.</p>

<p>Some of the things we'll be practicing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accessing the device's hardware (eg. camera, gps/location, gyro/vibrate)</li>
<li>Using the local data storage</li>
<li>Consuming data via web services</li>
<li>User Interface and Orientation</li>
</ul>


<p>We only have a few weeks left so it's a tall order, but if we can just scratch the surface, I think we'll be in good shape!</p>

<p>The cool thing about using a framework, is if we have time, we could potentially port it to other devices, like Android and Windows Phone :)</p>

<p>So here's to some awesomeness going down!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;you realize you&#8217;ve been in a bubble.  As most of my friends know, I&#8217;ve started a new job at <a href="http://www.sparcedge.com">SPARC</a>, a local software dev firm&#8230;but everytime I go into work, I feel like a little baby crawling on the floor or pooping in my pants!</p>




<p>From evented javascript design to being on the front lines of enterprise app development, there&#8217;s a lot to learn.  The people are all amazing, humble, and so extremely talented that it bends my perception of what I thought I knew.  Exaggeration aside, I am excited to learn and grow in this space and hope that I too can become proficient enough to be &#8216;smart&#8217;.</p>
