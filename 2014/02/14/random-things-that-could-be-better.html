    </header>

    <section class="post tag-random tag-improvement">
      <p><img src="http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/rage-guy-original.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So I was thinking today&#8230;well, I like to think that I think everyday, but in this case&#8230;my thinking has had a backlog of sorts.  I feel like I need to write this out as a sort of therapy to release my pressure valve.</p>
<p>Life is great for me right now, but &#8230;</p>
<p>Certain things that either have been annoying me or could be better have been bubbling up, but these &#8216;things&#8217; have no particular distinction of being related, save for them being annoying or have the potential to be better&#8230;</p>
<h3 id="why-doesn-t-chick-fil-a-have-a-self-serve-soda-dispenser-like-everyone-else-">Why doesn&#39;t Chick-fil-a have a self-serve soda dispenser like everyone else?</h3>
<p>You could probably make a good business case for why not:</p>
<ul>
<li>More efficient spending on soda syrup because less people will make effort to get refill</li>
<li>More interaction with customers face-to-face</li>
<li>Less mess to clean up</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that annoy me about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giant ice cubes fill the cup, leaving about 2.5 gulps of drink</li>
<li>I like diet coke, but everyone always hears, &#8216;coke&#8217;</li>
<li>Having to wait a long time when I&#8217;m thirsty</li>
</ul>
<p>The long and short of it is basically that&#8230;.I&#8217;ve been conditioned with every other fast food place that I can self serve and create my own concoction (sometimes I put fruit punch with my diet coke&#8230;.or have sprite with rootbeer).  I value this.</p>
<p>I also get annoyed when I am going through the drive thru getting ready to go on a long trip, only to run out of my caffeinated soda 3 blocks away from leaving the place.</p>
<p>The problem I see:</p>
<p> When you have to go back to get a refill, it clogs up the process and the area in which others are waiting to be served&#8230;people bump each other, children going up for refills get overlooked, parents going up on behalf of more than a few are left waiting in the sidelines&#8230;it just seems to get messy, which is probably why I never feel relaxed when dining in Chick-fil-a&#8230;there just seems to be so much traffic.</p>
<h3 id="amazon-you-could-do-better-with-your-hd-purchases-in-instant-video-and-probably-in-theory-get-more-people-to-convert-from-standard">Amazon, you could do better with your HD purchases in Instant Video and probably, in theory, get more people to convert from Standard</h3>
<p> I probably spend way more money than I should at Amazon, especially with Instant Video, but I don&#8217;t feel like Im alone in this as they make it amazingly easy to purchase their products, but the thing about it is&#8230;.</p>
<p> I always balk at buying HD video as opposed to the standard offering that is right beside it, and when I say balk, I mean I usually never buy the HD&#8230;but sometimes&#8230;especially if I were to get a larger tv or brand new HD flatscreen, I would consider purchasing the HD version of something I already bought&#8230;..but I don&#8217;t want to have 2 copies of the same thing.  It &#8216;feels&#8217; like I would be wasting my money.</p>
<p> So if I were Amazon&#8230;and I am not, but if I were, and I wanted to sell more HD Instant video, I would probably consider providing something like an upgrade option if the customer already owns the Standard format version.  So if I owned Pawn Stars (yes I do), and I bought the standard for $1.99&#8230;.then it might make sense to allow the customer to &#8216;upgrade&#8217; to the HD format for only a dollar more, instead of paying the full $2.99.  Doesn&#8217;t that make a lot more sense?</p>
<p> It just seems like a big missed opportunity if you wanted to convert more people to HD instant video. #amiright</p>
<h3 id="i-really-wish-more-people-used-primary-sources">I really wish more people used primary sources</h3>
<p> Facebook is probably the impetus for this one, but seriously&#8230;.question the information and where it came from!</p>
<p> A lot of people like to call our social media a &#8216;fire-hose&#8217; or something to the effect of a large ocean or web or something, but the fact is: A METRIC ASS-TON OF INFORMATION IS BLASTED INTO YOUR EYEBALLS, EARS&#8230;all the time!</p>
<p> my favorite quote:</p>
 <blockquote>What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. - Herbert Simon</blockquote>

<p> I suppose what I&#8217;m really getting at is not totally related to using primary sources, but evaluating the information you post.</p>
<p> To me, primary sources are the highest quality information you can get.  My opinions on my blog are a primary source, peer-reviewed scientific articles are usually primary sources, taking a picture at an event is a primary source.</p>
<p> Here&#8217;s a great example that I&#8217;ve seen in my feed a few times: <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/513771-girl-killed-herself-live-on-cam-just-after-dad-husband-seen-her-while-doing-this-a-facebook-scam/">http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/513771-girl-killed-herself-live-on-cam-just-after-dad-husband-seen-her-while-doing-this-a-facebook-scam/</a></p>
<h3 id="shared-facebook-accounts">Shared Facebook accounts</h3>
<p>I think the theme here is honesty, but moreso it&#8217;s goes back to primary sources.  I know some people do shared accounts as a gesture of oneness with their significant other, but I don&#8217;t really see the benefit.</p>
<p>I love my wife, and we are one couple, one unity under God, but we still are individuals, and when I speak, I may not be speaking for her and I want her to speak for herself.</p>
<p>It ultimately seems deceiving because I rarely know who is speaking from the account, and it&#8217;s just weird!</p>
<h3 id="whatevs-right">Whatevs, right</h3>
<p>Who cares, right?  Really though, there are so many day to day things that could be better, could be worse.  I just thought to highlight a few of them here.</p>
