## excited to start again and chasing unicorns

So I've been on hiatus from blogging and haven't really done it for the past few years, but I feel like lately I have a lot more to say.

Just in the past year I've gone through a lot of transformations from being a husband, and now (soon to be), father.  This is so amazing to me and I'd like to share.

I've also made a lot of new friends and have been pushing my development knowledge to new levels, mostly due to my work at SPARC and the amazing coworkers I have there.

Stay tuned as I begin documenting my adventures!
