It's been close to a year that I married my best friend and the person that inspires me everyday to be a better person.
Nearly 5 years ago I packed all my stuff up and moved to Charleston to find better opportunities both for life in general and to further my career in the world of web/software development.

I can honestly say that on all fronts, I couldn't be in a better position than I am now.

I married and became best friends with an amazing women, I have a baby on the way (less than 5wks now)...and I work at one of the best software development shops in SC.

Personally and professionally, I'm loving life.  And with the upcoming birth of our first child, I've been reflecting a lot on where I've been and where I want to be.

I find that I've been spending a lot of time worrying about how I will be as a father and will I be able to keep the pace with the demands of a new child.  I've let myself go health-wise and have become 'more of a man' from not paying attention to what I eat and the exercise I need to be healthy.  This, as I'm starting to realize, needs to change.

Changing these habits of eating and now exercising has been hard because I've been so unbalanced in my daily life, neglecting to really balance my personal needs.

I am aiming to change these bad habits and achieve more balance by honestly carving out time everyday to spend being active, whether it be a hike, the gym, or a fierce game of raquetball.

Time has been flying by and it's time for me to start making sure I will be around for a while!
