<p>&#8230;you realize you&#8217;ve been in a bubble.  As most of my friends know, I&#8217;ve started a new job at <a href="http://www.sparcedge.com">SPARC</a>, a local software dev firm&#8230;but everytime I go into work, I feel like a little baby crawling on the floor or pooping in my pants!</p>

<p>From evented javascript design to being on the front lines of enterprise app development, there&#8217;s a lot to learn.  The people are all amazing, humble, and so extremely talented that it bends my perception of what I thought I knew.  Exaggeration aside, I am excited to learn and grow in this space and hope that I too can become proficient enough to be &#8216;smart&#8217;..... this is some additions</p>
